### About

Stars of Pride Festival is a festival dedicated to the cause of spreading knowledge to the Asian LGBTQ+ community. It is well known that in countries in Asia, especially China, to have censorship to Gay couples and being different that normal. There was an online news that got viral where an author was sentenced to imprisonment for writing Danmei (Chinese novels that centers around male with male) That is why it is important to raise awareness of this cause for the freedom of expression and identity. Everyone has the right to be who they want to be, marry, and love who they want to love be it the same gender. It is the modern age where our mindset should start to change.
